	<h1>python</h1>
	<p> here is a program that runs python. right now, it shows an emoticon generator, but soon, once I have worked out all the bugs, I will post my text adventure. click the triangle to have the code do its function. it is fine if you delete the current code and code things yourself, because any time the page is loaded, the same thing will appear before I started coding in python I coded in scratch. below this are some of my best scratch games.</p>
